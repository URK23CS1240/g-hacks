# Carbon UI MVP

A small React + Tailwind scaffold implementing the UI/UX for a student carbon footprint tracker.
Designed around the principle: **Effortless Impact**.

## What you get
- Dashboard (hero stat + donut chart)
- Logging screen (quick transport logging)
- Instant results (impact + greener alternative)
- Progress screen (weekly bar chart + leaderboard)
- Components split for easy handoff to developers

## Run locally (dev)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   npm install --save recharts lucide-react
   ```
2. Configure Tailwind in your project (not included here).
3. Start the dev server (if using Vite or CRA configured):
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
4. Open `localhost:3000` (or Vite default port)

## Notes for Member 2
- Charts use `recharts`. Data arrays are hard-coded for the demo.
- Colors: primary `#2E8B57`, accent `#007AFF`, neutral `#F4F6F6`.
- Typography: use Poppins for headings and Inter for body (configure via Tailwind).
- Swap icons from `lucide-react` or Feather for visual consistency.

## Deliverables I can add next (pick one)
- Split into full Create React App / Vite project with Tailwind pre-configured.
- Generate a short 6-slide presentation summarizing screens & judging criteria.
- Provide Figma-like annotations (spacing, color swatches, assets).

Tell me which you want and I'll add it.
